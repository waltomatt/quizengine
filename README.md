# Quizengine
A basic quiz engine using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com) & Postgres.
Includes some basic functional tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
Project is dockerised so requires docker and docker-compose to run!

### Plan

### Testing
Some functional tests are present although due to time constraints didn't create unit tests for the class functions. Also uses [standard](https://standardjs.com/) to check code style.

```
$ npm install -D
$ npm test

```

### Running
`
$ npm install 
`
